Reasoning behind this project:

As somebody currently attempting to learn the japanese language, I will commonly find myself encountering characters (kanji specifically) that I don't recognize. However, since I don't recognize them, I can't simply look up their definition as it's basically just a drawing. This project helps solve that problem by allowing the user to simply redraw the kanji they have encountered and easily find its definition.


Data came from the Kuzushiji-Kanji dataset which can be found at
